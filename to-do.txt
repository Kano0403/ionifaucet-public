Priority goes from top [highest] to bottom [lowest]

ANTI-SPAM SYSTEM 

Probably make logging with CSV [associate time, date, name gifted, and ip to an email/hnsadr] (and maybe if someone tries to use a hns address and email seperately on the same IP, combine the log to only one entry per IP.)
optimise fl/flt/names/namesTemp system
add a file or part of a file that shows the amount of names remaining, so that the program does not have to count every time, causing lag.
actually see if the transfer was a success rather than just having a static page saying "success"
Fix on-chain transfers [needs a google 2fa code each time, not sure how we'll do this. if we can generate a google auth code in python, that's great and would solve the problem (but would defeat the point of 2fa, so i doubt it's possible.)]
Promo codes
Serve html from static files
ip ratelimiting
optimize loading times
Maybe add a referral system, with a discord bot to give roles in a server based on how many people are invited, or give the info to someone like johnnywu/ and have giveaways?
CSS
ads...? probably want some sort of monetization
hash emails, ips, and hns addresses and check with a hash so we can't see people's details
get real hosting so we can use port 80

prefix selector
scan owned domains in account and see if any of them start with "ioni-" or something, automatically put them in names.txt
